## Hero Banner / Slideshow:

- Per the prototype, there needs to be additional “slides” on the Hero Banner.
  o Overall slideshow functionality will need to be implemented
  o HTML markup will need to be added for additional slides
  o HTML markup is also needed for the arrows, navigational dots, etc.

## Feedback:

Finally, the client is very active in the project and requested a technical breakdown of what was
completed and how you resolved the missing requirements. They have also asked for feedback on how
User Interface/User Experience as well as Front End Development best code practices can be improved
upon in the future.
You can provide this technical feedback in either a written assessment OR via a quick screen recording
using a tool like Screencast-o-matic. The screen recording can simply consist of you narrating the
technical breakdown and improvement suggestions and share with us as part of the assessment
challenge.
